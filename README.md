# 👋 Hey there, I'm Thomas Mizobuchi

I’m an IT Support Specialist with over 10 years of real-world experience helping users, solving problems, and keeping systems running. Now, I’m focused on the next step: supporting cloud-first environments and modern IT infrastructure as a Cloud Support or Azure Technician.

I’ve spent years building strong technical fundamentals across Microsoft 365, Intune, and endpoint management — and now I’m actively leveling up my skills in Azure, automation, and cloud identity.

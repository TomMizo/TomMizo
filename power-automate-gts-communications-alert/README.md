# Power Automate: GTS Communications Alert Flow

##  Overview
This flow was created to ensure that important messages or alerts from the **GTS (Global Technology Services)** and **MI (Managed Infrastructure)** teams are immediately visible to the support team. It monitors communication channels and sends real-time notifications when key updates are received.

##  Flow Summary
- **Trigger:** (Likely tied to email, SharePoint, or a monitored source)
- **Logic:** Detects specific subject lines, keywords, or sources associated with GTS/MI alerts
- **Action:** Sends a notification or email to the IT team with the relevant message content

##  Impact
This automation helps reduce the chance of missing critical communications from infrastructure or global support teams, allowing for quicker response and better alignment during incident escalations or system changes.

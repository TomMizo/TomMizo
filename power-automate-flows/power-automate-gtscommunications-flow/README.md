# GTS/MI Communications Alert Flow

This is a Power Automate flow I created to alert our team when certain types of messages come in from the GTS or MI groups. It looks for specific keywords and sends a notification when thereâ€™s something we should know about.

---

### What It Does

- Looks for emails or messages from specific sources
- Filters based on subject or body content
- Sends a quick alert to the team if matched

---

### Why I Made It

Important messages from GTS/MI sometimes get buried in inboxes. This makes sure we catch them right away.

---

### Notes

- Can be expanded to post in Teams or log to SharePoint
- Needs reconnection to Outlook if imported to another tenant

### File

- `GTSCommunications_20250529150307.zip`
